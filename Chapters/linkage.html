            The
            <strong
              >tendency of genes to remain together in their original
              combination</strong
            >
            during inheritance is called <strong>linkage</strong>. This means
            that alleles at different loci on the same chromosome are often
            inherited as a single unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phenomenon of linkage was first reported by
            <strong>William Bateson and Reginald Punnett in 1906</strong> while
            studying sweet peas. They observed that certain traits did not
            assort independently as predicted by Mendel's laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, <strong>Thomas Hunt Morgan</strong>, through his work with
            <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> (fruit flies), extensively studied
            linkage and put forth the <strong>theory of linkage</strong>. He
            concluded that "coupling" (alleles of the same type, e.g., dominant
            with dominant, on the same chromosome) and "repulsion" (alleles of
            different types, e.g., dominant with recessive, on the same
            chromosome) were two phases of the single phenomenon of linkage.

            >Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
          </h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance</strong>, proposed
            independently by
            <strong>Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri</strong> in the early 20th
            century, provides the physical basis for Mendel's laws and the
            concept of linkage. Key tenets include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Genes are located on chromosomes.</li>
            <li>
              Chromosomes undergo segregation during meiosis, and assort
              independently (for chromosomes carrying different sets of genes).
            </li>
            <li>
              Genes located on the same chromosome (linked genes) tend to be
              inherited together because the chromosome acts as a single unit of
              transmission during meiosis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is now well established that many genes are located on each
            chromosome in a linear fashion. All genes located on the same
            chromosome would typically move to the same pole during cell
            division. As a consequence, such genes will fail to show independent
            segregation and would tend to be inherited together, demonstrating
            linkage.

            <span class="material-symbols-outlined mr-2">category</span>Types of
            Linkage
          </h2>
          <p>Linkage is generally classified based on three criteria:</p>
          <h3 class="mt-4">A) Based on Crossing Over</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Complete Linkage:</strong> Occurs when linked genes are so
              close together on a chromosome that crossing over (exchange of
              genetic material) between them is virtually absent. This results
              in only parental combinations of alleles in the offspring.
              Complete linkage is rare but has been observed, for example, in
              males of <em>Drosophila</em> and females of silkworms, where there
              is a complete absence of recombinant types due to the absence of
              crossing over for certain gene pairs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Incomplete/Partial Linkage:</strong> This is more common.
              It occurs when linked genes are separated by some distance on the
              chromosome, allowing for crossing over to occur between them,
              albeit at a frequency less than 50%. This results in both parental
              and recombinant (new combinations) types of offspring. Incomplete
              linkage has been observed in maize, pea,
              <em>Drosophila</em> females, and several other organisms.
            </li>
          </ul>

            class="diagram-image max-w-lg"
          />

          <h3 class="mt-4">B) Based on Genes Involved (Phases of Linkage)</h3>
          <p>
            This refers to the arrangement of alleles on the homologous
            chromosomes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Coupling Phase (cis arrangement):</strong> When dominant
              alleles of two or more linked genes are present on one chromosome,
              and their corresponding recessive alleles are on the homologous
              chromosome (e.g., AB/ab). <br /><code
                >TR / tr ---- Coupling phase</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repulsion Phase (trans arrangement):</strong> When a
              dominant allele of one gene and a recessive allele of another
              linked gene are present on one chromosome, and the reverse is true

          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Linkage involves two or more genes located on the same chromosome
              in a linear fashion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage reduces variability by keeping parental gene combinations
              together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage may involve either dominant or recessive alleles (coupling
              phase) or some dominant and some recessive alleles (repulsion
              phase).
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage usually involves genes that are located close to each
              other.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>strength of linkage</strong> is inversely proportional
              to the distance between the linked genes. Closer genes show
              stronger linkage (less recombination), while genes farther apart
              show weaker linkage (more recombination).
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage can be determined from test cross progeny data by
              observing deviations from expected Mendelian ratios.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linked genes tend to remain in their original combination during

          <p>
            The most common method for detecting linkage is the
            <strong>test cross</strong>. In this method, an F<sub>1</sub>
            individual heterozygous at two (or more) loci (e.g., AB/ab) is
            crossed with a parent homozygous recessive for all genes being
            studied (e.g., ab/ab).

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>If genes are unlinked (independent assortment):</strong>
              The test cross progeny will show a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four
              possible phenotypic classes (two parental, two recombinant).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>If genes are linked:</strong> The frequency of parental
              types will be significantly higher than 50%, and the frequency of
              recombinant types will be significantly lower than 50%. The
              deviation from the 1:1:1:1 ratio indicates linkage. The percentage
              of recombinant offspring (recombination frequency) is used to
              measure the distance between linked genes.

            >Examples of Linkage
          </h2>
          <h3>Linkage in Maize (Corn)</h3>
          <p>
            Hutchinson conducted experiments with maize, crossing a variety with
            coloured and full seeds (CCSS) with a variety having colourless and
            shrunken seeds (ccss). The gene C (colour) is dominant over c
            (colourless), and S (full seed) is dominant over s (shrunken seed).
          </p>
          <p>
            The F<sub>1</sub> generation (CcSs) all had coloured, full seeds.
            When F<sub>1</sub> females were test-crossed with colourless,
            shrunken (ccss) males, the following results were observed
            (approximate percentages from PDF):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Coloured, full (CS - parental): ~48.2%</li>
            <li>Colourless, shrunken (cs - parental): ~48.2%</li>
            <li>Coloured, shrunken (Cs - recombinant): ~1.8%</li>
            <li>Colourless, full (cS - recombinant): ~1.8%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Parental combinations (CS and cs) accounted for about 96.4%, while
            new combinations (Cs and cS) were about 3.6%. This significant
            deviation from the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio (if unlinked) clearly
            indicates that the genes for seed colour and seed shape are linked
            in maize. This is an example of <strong>incomplete linkage</strong>.

          <h3>Linkage in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> (Fruit Fly)</h3>
          <p>
            T.H. Morgan's experiments with <em>Drosophila</em> were pivotal in
            understanding linkage.
          </p>
          <h4>Experiment 1 (White eyes, Miniature wings):</h4>
          <p>
            Morgan crossed female flies with white eyes (w) and miniature wings
            (m) (both recessive) with wild-type males (red eyes w<sup>+</sup>,
            normal wings m<sup>+</sup>). The F<sub>1</sub> females were
            wild-type (heterozygous w<sup>+</sup>m<sup>+</sup>/wm). When these
            F<sub>1</sub> females were test-crossed, the parental types (white
            eyes, miniature wings and wild-type eyes, wild-type wings) were far
            more numerous than the recombinant types (white eyes, wild-type
            wings and wild-type eyes, miniature wings). The recombination
            frequency was calculated to be about 36.8% (from PDF image data),
            indicating linkage.

          <h4>
            Experiment 2 (Grey body, Long wings - Complete Linkage Example in
            Males):
          </h4>
          <p>
            Morgan crossed wild-type <em>Drosophila</em> with grey body and long
            wings (BBVV) with a mutant type having black body and vestigial
            wings (bbvv). The F<sub>1</sub> hybrids (BbVv) were grey-bodied with
            long wings.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an F<sub>1</sub> male (BbVv) was back-crossed with a double
            recessive female (bbvv), only parental combinations (grey body, long
            wings and black body, vestigial wings) appeared in the F<sub>2</sub>
            generation. No new combinations were observed. This indicated
            <strong>complete linkage</strong> between the genes for body colour
            and wing type in <em>Drosophila</em> males for these specific genes,
            meaning no crossing over occurred between them in males.

            <li>
              Linkage limits variability among individuals by keeping parental
              gene combinations together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage between two or more loci controlling different desirable
              characters is advantageous for a plant breeder. It helps in the
              simultaneous improvement of both characters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage is undesirable when desirable and undesirable genes are
              linked together, making it difficult to separate them. This is
              known as "linkage drag."
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage plays an important role in determining the nature and
              scope of hybridization and selection programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linkage reduces the chance of recombination of genes and thus
              helps to hold parental characteristics together. It helps
              organisms maintain their parental, racial, and other characters.
              For this reason, plant and animal breeders may find it difficult
              to combine various characters if they are trying to break
              unfavorable linkages.

            >Crossing Over
          </h2>

            <strong>Crossing over</strong> is the
            <strong
              >exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of
              homologous chromosomes</strong
            >
            during meiosis (specifically, in Prophase I). This process results
            in new allelic combinations in the daughter cells, leading to
            genetic recombination.
          </p>
          <p>Key points about crossing over:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each diploid cell contains two copies of every chromosome (one
              maternal, one paternal), forming
              <strong>homologous chromosomes</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              During sexual reproduction, diploid organisms produce haploid
              gametes through <strong>meiosis</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In <strong>Prophase I of meiosis</strong>, homologous chromosomes
              pair up (synapsis) and exchange segments of genetic material.
            </li>
            <li>
              The resultant chromosomes are <strong>recombinants</strong>,
              containing a mixture of genes derived from both maternal and
              paternal chromosomes.

            >Example of Crossing Over in Drosophila
          </h2>
          <p>
            Consider factors for eye color and wing shape in
            <em>Drosophila</em>: pink eyes (r) and curled wings (c) are
            recessive, while red eyes (R) and straight wings (C) are dominant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a pure-breeding fly with red eyes and straight wings (RRCC) is
            mated with a fly having pink eyes and curled wings (rrcc):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The F<sub>1</sub> hybrids are all red-eyed and straight-winged
              (RrCc).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When an F<sub>1</sub> female (RrCc) is back-crossed with a male
            having pink eyes and curled wings (rrcc - test cross), the F<sub
              >2</sub
            >
            generation might show (example percentages from PDF):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Red eyes, straight wings (RC - parental): 49%</li>
            <li>Pink eyes, curled wings (rc - parental): 49%</li>
            <li>Red eyes, curled wings (Rc - recombinant/cross-over): 1%</li>
            <li>Pink eyes, straight wings (rC - recombinant/cross-over): 1%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The parental types constitute 98%, while the recombinant
            (cross-over) types constitute 2%. This indicates that the genes for
            eye color and wing shape are linked, and crossing over occurs
            between them at a frequency of 2%.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the genes were on different chromosomes (unlinked), all four
            classes would appear in approximately equal numbers (25% each). If
            they were completely linked with no crossing over, only the two
            parental types would appear.

            >Theories of Chromosomal Crossing Over
          </h2>
          <p>
            Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of
            crossing over:
          </p>
          <h4>1. The 'Contact First' Theory (Serebrovsky)</h4>
          <p>
            This theory states that two non-sister chromatids first contact and
            then cross each other. Breakage occurs at the point of contact, and
            the broken segments reunite to form new combinations.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://placehold.co/400x200/e5e7eb/4b5563?text=Fig+61:+Contact+First+Theory"
            alt="Diagram based on Fig 61 from PDF: Contact First Theory"
            class="diagram-image max-w-md"
          />

          <h4>2. The 'Breakage First' Theory (Muller)</h4>
          <p>
            According to this theory, two inner non-sister chromatids first
            break into segments without crossing over. Then, the broken segments
            reunite with each other, forming new arrangements and resulting in
            new combinations. This theory is widely accepted.
          </p>
          <img

            class="diagram-image max-w-md"
          />

          <h4>3. Strain Theory (Precosity Theory - Darlington)</h4>
          <p>
            Darlington proposed that chromosomal breakage occurs due to strain
            or tension during pairing. When homologous chromosomes pair and
            twist around each other (relational coiling), tension develops on
            the chromatids, causing them to break at points of contact.
            Recombination occurs when broken ends rejoin, not necessarily with
            their original segments. Chiasmata (visible cross-over points) are
            thought to hold the broken chromatids together.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Belling's Hypothesis</h4>
          <p>
            Belling (1933) suggested that crossing over results from an exchange
            between newly duplicated chromatids during their formation. New
            chromomeres (segments of a chromosome) are formed alongside their
            sister chromosomes, and interconnecting fibers form later. If
            relational coiling exists, these fibers might form between
            non-sister chromomeres, producing a cross-over.

            Crossing Over
          </h2>
          <p>
            Crossing over can be classified based on the number of chiasmata
            (points of exchange) present:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Single Crossing Over:</strong> Occurs when there is only
              one chiasma or crossing over event at one point in a chromosome
              pair. This produces single cross-over gametes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Double Crossing Over:</strong> Occurs when crossing over
              happens at two points in the same chromosome pair. This produces
              double cross-over gametes and is less frequent than single
              crossing over.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multiple Crossing Over:</strong> Crossing over can also
              occur at three, four, or more points in the same chromosome pair,
              referred to as triple, quadruple, or multiple crossing over,
              respectively. These are progressively rarer.

          </h2>
          <h4>1. Classical Theory (Morgan and Sharp - Two-Plane Theory)</h4>
          <p>
            This theory, now largely of historical significance, proposed that
            chiasma formation occurs when a chromatid of one chromosome
            associates with a non-sister chromatid of its homolog. It suggested
            chiasma formation was the cause, not the result, of crossing over,
            and that not every chiasma led to recombination. This theory is not
            supported by current evidence.

            2. Chiasma Type Theory (Janssens, Belling, Darlington - Breakage &
            Reunion Theory / One-Plane Theory)
          </h4>
          <p>
            This widely accepted theory posits that breakage occurs in
            non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, followed by the
            reunion of chromatid segments, resulting in crossing over. Chiasmata
            are formed at the points where crossing over has taken place when
            homologous chromosomes begin to separate during the diplotene stage
            of Prophase I.
          </p>
          <p>Key points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Chiasma is the result (cytological manifestation) of a crossing
              over event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each chiasma generally corresponds to one genetic crossing over
              event (1:1 ratio).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <img

            class="diagram-image max-w-lg"
          />
          <p>
            While generally supported, some observations (like chiasmata in male
            Drosophila where genetic crossing over is rare for some chromosomes)
            have led to further refinements and understanding that not all
            chiasmata might lead to reciprocal recombination in all cases or
            species.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Copy-Choice Theory (Lederberg)</h4>
          <p>
            Proposed by J. Lederberg (1955), this theory suggested that
            duplication and recombination occur simultaneously. Newly
            synthesized genes could switch templates during replication, leading
            to recombinant strands. This theory faces objections, such as the
            fact that crossing over involves existing chromatids, not just newly
            synthesized ones, and DNA replication largely precedes synapsis and
            crossing over.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The modern understanding of crossing over involves precise molecular
            events:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Double-Strand Break (DSB):</strong> The process often
              begins with a programmed double-strand break in the DNA of one
              chromatid, typically initiated by specific enzymes like Spo11.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resection:</strong> Exonucleases (enzymes that remove
              nucleotides) process the broken ends, removing short stretches of
              nucleotides from the 5' ends. This creates 3' single-stranded
              tails.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Strand Invasion:</strong> One of the 3' single-stranded
              tails, coated with proteins like Rad51 (a recombinase), "invades"
              the homologous DNA duplex of a non-sister chromatid, searching for
              a complementary sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>D-loop Formation:</strong> Upon finding homology, the
              invading strand displaces one strand of the homologous duplex,
              forming a displacement loop (D-loop).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DNA Synthesis:</strong> The invading 3' end acts as a
              primer for DNA synthesis, using the intact strand of the
              homologous chromatid as a template. This extends the invading
              strand.
            </li>

              <strong
                >Capture of the Second End & Holliday Junction
                Formation:</strong
              >
              The displaced D-loop can pair with the other 3' single-stranded
              tail from the original DSB. Further DNA synthesis and ligation
              (joining of DNA fragments by DNA ligase) can lead to the formation
              of a structure with two crossover points called a
              <strong>double Holliday junction</strong>. A Holliday junction is
              a branched nucleic acid structure containing four DNA strands.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resolution of Holliday Junctions:</strong> The Holliday
              junctions must be resolved (cut and rejoined) to separate the
              homologous chromosomes. This resolution can occur in two ways:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Crossover:</strong> If the two junctions are resolved
                  by cutting different pairs of strands (one inner and one outer
                  at each junction, or specific orientations), it results in an
                  exchange of flanking chromosomal arms, leading to a genetic
                  crossover.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Non-crossover:</strong> If both junctions are resolved
                  by cutting the same pairs of strands (e.g., both inner
                  strands), it results in gene conversion (a short segment of
                  DNA from one chromatid is copied to the other) without the
                  exchange of flanking arms. This is often associated with the
                  Synthesis-Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) pathway.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Proteins like MSH4 and MSH5 are involved in stabilizing Holliday
            junctions and promoting crossover outcomes.

            <span class="material-symbols-outlined mr-2">tune</span>Factors
            Affecting Crossing Over
          </h2>
          <p>
            The frequency of crossing over can be influenced by various genetic,
            physiological, and environmental factors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sex:</strong> Crossing over frequency often differs
              between sexes. For example, it's generally absent or greatly
              reduced in male <em>Drosophila</em> and female silkworms. The
              heterogametic sex (e.g., XY males in humans) often shows lower
              recombination rates than the homogametic sex (e.g., XX females).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mutation:</strong> Certain gene mutations can affect
              crossing over rates. For instance, some mutations in
              <em>Drosophila</em> reduce crossing over across all chromosomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Age:</strong> The age of the individual can influence
              crossing over. In <em>Drosophila</em> females, for example,
              crossing over tends to decrease with age.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inversion:</strong> Chromosomal inversions (where a
              segment of a chromosome is flipped) suppress crossing over within
              the inverted region in heterozygotes. However, crossing over might
              increase in adjacent, normally paired regions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>X-radiation and other Radiations:</strong> Exposure to
              X-rays (Muller) or radium (Hanson) can increase the frequency of
              crossing over.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature:</strong> Extreme temperatures (both low and
              high) can increase crossing over frequency in organisms like
              female <em>Drosophila</em> (Plough).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Centromere Vicinity (Chromosomal Region):</strong>
              Crossing over is generally less frequent near centromeres
              (centromeric heterochromatin) and at the tips of chromosomes
              (telomeres). It's more frequent in euchromatic regions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Somatic Crossing Over:</strong> While rare, crossing over
              can occur in somatic (body) cells, known as mitotic crossing over.
              This was first studied by Stern in <em>Drosophila</em>. It can
              lead to patches of tissue with a recombinant genotype but has no
              genetic importance for inheritance to offspring. Certain mutations
              (e.g., "minute" bristles in <em>Drosophila</em>) can increase its
              frequency.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Factors that affect crossing over will inversely affect the strength
            of linkage (e.g., increased crossing over leads to weaker linkage).

            >Functions of Crossing Over
          </h2>
          <p>Crossing over plays crucial roles in genetics and evolution:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Increases Genetic Variability:</strong> It is a primary
              source of genetic variation in sexually reproducing populations by
              creating new combinations of alleles on chromosomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facilitates Evolution:</strong> Genetic variation is the
              raw material for natural selection. Crossing over allows favorable
              mutations that arise on different chromosomes to be combined, and
              unfavorable combinations to be broken apart.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prevents Muller's Ratchet:</strong> In asexual
              populations, deleterious mutations can accumulate irreversibly
              (Muller's Ratchet). Sexual reproduction with crossing over allows
              for the creation of chromosomes with fewer deleterious mutations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ensures Proper Chromosome Segregation:</strong> In many
              organisms, at least one crossover per chromosome arm is necessary
              for the proper pairing and subsequent segregation of homologous
              chromosomes during Meiosis I. Chiasmata physically hold homologs
              together until anaphase I.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Allows Gene Mapping:</strong> The frequency of crossing
              over between linked genes is proportional to the distance between
              them. This principle is used to construct genetic maps, showing
              the relative locations of genes on chromosomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduces Linkage Disequilibrium:</strong> It helps to break
              down associations between alleles at different loci, moving
              populations closer to linkage equilibrium.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adaptability:</strong> The genetic diversity generated by
              crossing over can increase a population's ability to adapt to
              changing environments and resist diseases. If an epidemic occurs,
              genetic variability reduces the chance of the entire population
              being wiped out.
